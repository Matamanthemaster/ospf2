There is a secure channel, and the challenge response protocol has been accepted. Protocol details are also accepted. For a network status, this state is not applicable.

This could be a version incompatibility, or flags that are incompatible, including K values, or failed encryption. Nodes incompatible get soft locked from forming adjacency, setting a 1 hour timer, which neither nodes will attempt to form an adjacency with each other. For a network status, this state is not applicable.
