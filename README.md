<h1>OSPF routing protocol prototype for masterâ€™s dissertation research.</h1>
<br>
Modified to limit scope of standard OSPF, and to operate over UDP to allow easy implementation. The experiment
tests relative performance difference in an AB test, and so there doesn't need to be complete feature parity
or interoperability.
