DPLP routing protocol prototype for masterâ€™s dissertation research.
DPLP is the routing protocol design by myself for COM740: Network Protocols & Algorithms.<br><br>

Standard protocol borrowing operation from RFC2328 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2328),
done in a way to work closer to DPLP (e.g. using transport protocols instead of baking my own, making it very difficult to create).
